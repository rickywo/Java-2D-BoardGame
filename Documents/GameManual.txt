Humans vs. Aliens Game Design Document
======================================
Description of Game:
--------------------
Turn­based strategy RPG­style board game with two opposing forces (humans and 

aliens) utilizing combat system, job/role system and weapons system. 

Story:
------
Humans land on an unknown planet, discovering another life form already inhabiting 

it. Upon landing, a small group of humans wanders too far, alerting the aliens to the 

humans’ arrival and the subsequent capture of that small squad of humans. Another 

human witnesses this and runs back to the humans’ landing area, informing the 

Commander, leader of the humans sent to explore the planet, to what they’ve just 

seen. The Commander sends out ten soldiers inclusive of himself (herself?) to 

retrieve the captured group, meanwhile the alien forces gather ten members to 

exterminate the invaders.

Alternate Story Endings:

(I just brain-stormed something random, please add more endings so the game can 

randomly choose one at the end!)

If humans win, they save the captive humans and escape the planet, returning to 

Earth. On Earth humans attempt to make amends for their invasion of the aliens and 

send a spaceship to try to communicate with the aliens in a friendly manner.

If aliens win, the captive humans are used for various experiments. The aliens 

manage to learn the human language and use this to communicate to humans via 

radio telescope.

Job Descriptions:
-----------------
Humans:

Initial Jobs:

Commander – leader of the team (special ability??) 

Soldier – initial role for everyone else – can do basic attack (no weapon)

Jobs requiring weapon pickup:

Medic – heals team members [Special ability: Generates HP over time]

Long­range attacker – attacks from afar (e.g. cannon)

Close­range attacker – attacks from close­by 

Defender – shields team members from enemy attacks

Combat Engineer – sets traps, uses mines/hidden bombs (sabotages enemy team)

Cheerleader – boosts the stats of the team (e.g. increases defense, strength)

Aliens

Initial Jobs:

Chief – leader of the team (special ability??)

Spawn (another name please!) – initial role for all other aliens – can do a basic ability 

(what will that be??)

Jobs requiring weapon pickup:

[Insert alien roles here] – need to be different from humans

Weapon Descriptions:

One weapon per job role.

Cannon – Long­range attacker

Gun – Close­range attacker

Magical hands – Medic

Shield – Defender

Combat kit (consisting of various equipment, traps, bombs) ­ Combat Engineer

Flag – Cheerleader

Stats for each Job Role:

Each job has a HP, Strength, Defense

[Insert Stats Here]

E.g. Medic can have 50 HP, 20 Strength, 10 Defense. (Note: Strength means how 

strong their healing power is)

E.g. Defender can have 100 HP, 30 Strength, 30 Defense (Strength is ability to 

defend teammates, defense is ability to defend itself)

Game Rules:
-----------
This is a 2 player game – players need to decide if they will play as humans or 

aliens. Players move across the board to collect weapons, battle enemies or support 

their team.

Each team starts with ten pieces. (Humans: 1 Commander, 9 soldiers) (Aliens: 1 

Chief, 9 spawn?)

One piece can only have one role (and therefore only one weapon) at any one time. 

Exception is the basic starting roles of soldier/spawn that all pieces already have and 

continue to have throughout the game.

Initial Setup:

Hexagonal “squares” or tiles covering the entire board, the board itself is immobile, 

each tile can represent a tile of grass, dirt, water etc.

All 20 pieces and a number of weapons are randomly placed on the board.

Every piece except the leaders of each force (commander, chief) are given the initial 

role of soldier/spawn.

Moving around the Board:

Players roll a die, player with the highest roll moves first.

If player rolls a 3, choose a piece and move it 3 spaces. 

Landing on a Weapon:

Player can choose to pick up the weapon (and therefore assuming the weapon’s job 

role), or not pick up the weapon. If the player already has a role and chooses to pick 

up the weapon they relinquish their current role and assume the new role, dropping 

their current weapon on the current tile and picking up the new weapon. 

Landing on a square occupied by the Enemy:

Initiates Battle

Landing on a square occupied by a Teammate:

If the 2 pieces complement each other (supporting role and attacker etc.), this 

combination can be used should the enemy initiate battle with the pieces in the next 

turn.

If the 2 pieces are of similar role (attacker/attacker, defender/defender), then nothing 

special happens if a battle starts in next turn.

If the 2 pieces are medic and any other piece, the medic can heal the other piece. 

(Did we agree on this? I’m not sure)

After battle, if 2 pieces of the same team were both used in the same battle, they 

must separate onto different squares on the next turn.

Battle System:
--------------
Battle is initiated when a piece moves onto a square occupied by the enemy.

Generally, this means 2 pieces, one from each side, entering battle. 

In the event of 3 or more pieces being on the same square, and the supporting 

pieces are valid (valid combination of attacker/defender, attacker/medic etc.), then all 

the valid pieces enter battle.

Turn­based battle:

Each side takes turns specifying an attack, each attack reduces the enemy piece’s 

HP. If the other side has 2 pieces, you can only damage one piece. Battle ends 

when one side has been defeated (HP reaches 0 for all pieces on that side). Those 

pieces die and are removed from the game.

How to win (End of Game):

The leader of the other team dies. This could mean the entire team being killed.

NOTES:
------
Might be too easy to wipe out pieces in battle – should be able to summon the medic 

if needed? Or summon another piece? 

When you defeat a piece in battle should you gain the piece? Rather than it being 

removed from the game entirely. Of course if a human beats an alien the human will 

gain another human piece not an alien piece. This will make the game last longer – 

can use more strategy.

Long­range attacker maybe can initiate battle from 3 squares away (otherwise what’s 

the point of having it?)

Make it so medics and defenders can’t initiate battle? Since they would just keep 

healing/defending themselves anyway, unless they use the simple attack they were 

given...? But of course an enemy can initiate battle with them.
